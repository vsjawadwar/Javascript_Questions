/*
Write a JavaScript program to check whether a given matrix is an identity matrix. 
Note: In linear algebra, the identity matrix, or sometimes ambiguously called a unit matrix, of size n is the n ? n square matrix with ones on the main diagonal and zeros elsewhere.
[[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]] -> true
[[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1]] -> false
